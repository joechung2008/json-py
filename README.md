# json-py

JSON parser ported from TypeScript to Python 3.13.7

## License

MIT

## Reference

[json.org](http://json.org)

## Usage

### Run CLI with user input

```sh
python -m src.cli.main
```

You will be prompted to enter JSON input interactively.

### Run CLI with a shell command

```sh
echo '{"key": "value"}' | python -m src.cli.main
```

This allows you to pass JSON data directly to the CLI.

## Running the Django API Server

To start the Django API server for the API endpoint, use Django's built-in development server.

First, navigate to the Django project directory and then run the server:

```sh
cd src/api_django
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start the Django server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Running the FastAPI Server

To start the FastAPI server for the API endpoint:

`uvicorn` is a lightning-fast ASGI server for Python web applications. It runs your FastAPI app by serving requests to the `app` object defined in your code. When you run the command below, uvicorn loads your FastAPI application and handles HTTP requests, providing automatic reloading during development.

```sh
uvicorn src.api_fastapi.main:app --reload
```

This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Running the Flask API Server

To start the Flask API server for the API endpoint, use Flask's built-in development server.  
Make sure the following code is at the end of `src/api_flask/main.py`:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, debug=True)
```

Then run the server from your project root:

```sh
python -m src.api_flask.main
```

This will start the Flask server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Sending Test Requests with REST Client Extension

You can use the [REST Client extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) in VS Code to send requests to the FastAPI server.

Create a file (e.g., `test-api.http`) with the following content:

```http
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/parse HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: text/plain

{"key": "value"}
```

Click "Send Request" above the request in VS Code to test the API.

## Project Configuration with pyproject.toml

This project uses a `pyproject.toml` file for configuration and dependency management.  
`pyproject.toml` is a standardized file for Python projects that defines build system requirements and project metadata.

You do not run or view `pyproject.toml` with a command; it is a configuration file that you can open and edit in any text editor.  
Tools like Poetry read this file automatically when you run commands such as `poetry install`.

### Poetry

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is used for dependency management and packaging.  
Install dependencies with:

```sh
poetry install
```

See the [Poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for details.

## Formatting Code with Black

To format all Python files in the project:

```sh
black .
```

This will automatically format your code according to Black's style guide.

## Linting Code

To lint all Python files in the project:

```sh
ruff check .
```

This will check your code for style and programming errors.

## Running Tests

To run all Python tests using unittest:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -v
```

## Measuring Test Coverage

To run tests and measure coverage:

```sh
coverage run -m unittest discover
```

To generate a coverage report:

```sh
coverage report
```

To generate an HTML coverage report:

```sh
coverage html
```

Open `htmlcov/index.html` in your browser to view the detailed coverage report.

## Linux Setup: Running CLI and API Servers

To run the CLI and API servers on Linux, follow these steps:

1. **Install Poetry** (if not already installed):

```bash
pipx install poetry
```

   Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH.

2. **Install project dependencies:**

```bash
poetry install
```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

```bash
source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
```

4. **Run the CLI interactively:**

```bash
python -m src.cli.main

# Use Poetry script
poetry run cli
```

5. **Run the CLI with piped input:**

```bash
echo '{"key": "value"}' | python -m src.cli.main
```

6. **Run the FastAPI server:**

```bash
uvicorn src.api_fastapi.main:app --reload
```

The server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

7. **Run the Flask API server:**

```bash
python -m src.api_flask.main
```

The server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

8. **Run the Django API server:**

```bash
cd src/api_django
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

If you encounter missing dependencies, re-run `poetry install` after activating your environment. For more details, see the sections above.
